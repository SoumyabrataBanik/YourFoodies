# YourFoodies - The Food Sharing Community Website

## Disclaimer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About this Project

This project is my first experiment with NextJS and TypeScript where I try to develop an SSR website. It is a simple project that has some dummy texts.

It has three pages: the Browse Meals (menu) page, the community page and the sharing page. 

The **Community** Page is a simple page that just outputs a block of dummy text. Nothing special about it.

The **Browse Meals** Page is where all the meals are present. It acts like the menu. Each meal can be clicked a subsequent details page will open up which will show some dummy details about the meals.

The **Share Your Recipe** Page contains a form that asks for details about your recipe which then you can upload to the database.
